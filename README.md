# SkelPHP Routing

*NOTE: The Skel framework is an __experimental__ web applications framework that I've created as an exercise in various systems design concepts. While I do intend to use it regularly on personal projects, it was not necessarily intended to be a "production" framework, since I don't ever plan on providing extensive technical support (though I do plan on providing extensive documentation). It should be considered a thought experiment and it should be used at your own risk. Read more about its conceptual foundations at [my website](https://colors.kaelshipman.me/about/this-website).*

This is a very (*very*) basic implementation of request routing functionality. I'm not very committed to it, and will probably morph it into something else down the road.

## Usage

Eventually, this package is intended to be loaded as a composer package. For now, though, because this is still in very active development, I currently use it via a git submodule:

```bash
cd ~/my-website
git submodule add git@github.com:kael-shipman/skelphp-routing.git app/dev-src/skelphp/routing
```

This allows me to develop it together with the website I'm building with it. For more on the (somewhat awkward and complex) concept of git submodules, see [this page](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Tools-Submodules).
